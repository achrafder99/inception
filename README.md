## Project Overview: Docker-based System Infrastructure

This project dives deep into system administration using Docker, challenging individuals to set up a robust infrastructure within a virtual machine environment. From configuring NGINX with strict TLS protocols to orchestrating WordPress, php-fpm, and MariaDB containers, participants build Docker images, employ volumes for databases and website files, and establish network connections between containers. Comprising mandatory and bonus tasks, it emphasizes adherence to best practices, secure configuration without publicly exposed credentials, and optional advanced services like Redis cache and an FTP server. The projectâ€™s success hinges on meticulous implementation of Dockerfiles, networking, and environment variable usage, culminating in a fully functional and secure system. This GitHub repository showcases the mastery of Docker orchestration and system administration skills.

## What is A docker and how its work 
<ul>
<li>Docker Engine</li>: At its core is the Docker Engine, which manages the containers. It consists of a server (daemon) and a REST API, allowing users to interact with Docker. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon via commands.

<li>Images</li>: Containers are created based on Docker images. Images are templates that contain everything needed to run an application: the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Images are built from Dockerfiles, which are text files containing instructions to assemble an image.

<li>Containers</li>: When you run an image, it becomes a container. Containers are instances of images that can be started, stopped, moved, and deleted. They run in isolation from each other and share the resources of the host machine.

<li>Dockerfile</li>: This is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It includes commands to specify the base image, install dependencies, copy files, set environment variables, and define what happens when the container starts.

<li>Registry</li>: Docker images can be stored in registries like Docker Hub, a public repository, or private registries. These registries allow users to share and distribute their images.

<li>Networking and Volumes</li>: Docker provides networking capabilities to connect containers and allows data to persist beyond the lifecycle of a container using volumes.
