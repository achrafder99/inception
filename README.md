## Project Overview: Docker-based System Infrastructure

This project dives deep into system administration using Docker, challenging individuals to set up a robust infrastructure within a virtual machine environment. From configuring NGINX with strict TLS protocols to orchestrating WordPress, php-fpm, and MariaDB containers, participants build Docker images, employ volumes for databases and website files, and establish network connections between containers. Comprising mandatory and bonus tasks, it emphasizes adherence to best practices, secure configuration without publicly exposed credentials, and optional advanced services like Redis cache and an FTP server. The projectâ€™s success hinges on meticulous implementation of Dockerfiles, networking, and environment variable usage, culminating in a fully functional and secure system. This GitHub repository showcases the mastery of Docker orchestration and system administration skills.
