## Project Overview: Docker-based System Infrastructure
This project dives deep into system administration using Docker, challenging individuals to set up a robust infrastructure within a virtual machine environment. From configuring NGINX with strict TLS protocols to orchestrating WordPress, php-fpm, and MariaDB containers, participants build Docker images, employ volumes for databases and website files, and establish network connections between containers. Comprising mandatory and bonus tasks, it emphasizes adherence to best practices, secure configuration without publicly exposed credentials, and optional advanced services like Redis cache and an FTP server. The projectâ€™s success hinges on meticulous implementation of Dockerfiles, networking, and environment variable usage, culminating in a fully functional and secure system. This GitHub repository showcases the mastery of Docker orchestration and system administration skills.

## What is A docker and how its work 
Docker is a platform that enables developers to build, package, and deploy applications within containers. Containers are a form of lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that encapsulate software and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.
<ul>
<li>Docker Engine</li> At its core is the Docker Engine, which manages the containers. It consists of a server (daemon) and a REST API, allowing users to interact with Docker. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon via commands.

<li>Images</li> Containers are created based on Docker images. Images are templates that contain everything needed to run an application: the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Images are built from Dockerfiles, which are text files containing instructions to assemble an image.

<li>Containers</li> When you run an image, it becomes a container. Containers are instances of images that can be started, stopped, moved, and deleted. They run in isolation from each other and share the resources of the host machine.

<li>Dockerfile</li> This is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It includes commands to specify the base image, install dependencies, copy files, set environment variables, and define what happens when the container starts.

<li>Registry</li> Docker images can be stored in registries like Docker Hub, a public repository, or private registries. These registries allow users to share and distribute their images.

<li>Networking and Volumes</li> Docker provides networking capabilities to connect containers and allows data to persist beyond the lifecycle of a container using volumes.
</ul>

## What is a container 
In the world of Docker, a container is like a self-contained box for your application. It packages up your code, runtime environment, system tools, and settings into a single unit that can run on any Linux system, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

Here's a breakdown of what a Docker container is and what it does:

<ul>
  <li>Isolation:</li>
Containerized applications are isolated from each other and the host system. This means they don't share resources or interfere with each other, making them more secure and predictable.

<li>Portability:</li>
Containers are lightweight and portable, meaning they can be easily moved between different environments, like laptops, servers, and cloud platforms, without needing modifications.

<li>Standardization:</li>
Docker containers are based on standardized images, which are pre-built packages containing everything needed to run a specific application. This simplifies development and deployment, as you don't need to manually configure the environment each time.

<li>Efficiency:</li>
Containers share the underlying operating system kernel with the host system, which makes them more efficient than virtual machines. They start up faster and consume fewer resources, making them ideal for microservices and cloud-native applications.
</ul>

## What is a volume

A Docker volume is a persistent data storage mechanism used in Docker containers. It enables data to persist beyond the lifespan of a container. When a Docker container is removed, any data that was created or modified within the container's filesystem is usually lost. However, Docker volumes provide a way to store and manage data separately from the container itself.

<ul>
<li>Volumes can be used to</li>
Persist Data: Docker volumes allow you to store data generated or used by containers, such as databases, configuration files, logs, or any other data that needs to persist even if the container is stopped or deleted.

<li>Share Data Between Containers</li>
Volumes can be shared among multiple containers, enabling them to access and modify the same data.

<li>Backup and Restore</li> They facilitate easy backup and restoration of container data by separating it from the container instance.

<li>Performance Improvement</li>Volumes can be more efficient than using bind mounts (where a specific directory on the host is mounted into a container) because they're managed by Docker and can offer better performance.

Docker volumes can be managed using Docker commands or specified in a Docker Compose file to define and control data persistence for containers. They can be either anonymous (automatically created by Docker) or named (user-defined). Additionally, various volume drivers exist, allowing you to store data in different types of external storage systems like local directories, cloud storage, network storage, and more.
